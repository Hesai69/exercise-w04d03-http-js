# HTTP Server Reps!

Using what we know about Node and HTTP construct a simple server
that does the following:

When a user visits '/'
  Show a page that displays a title and an image of your favorite actor or actress

When a user visits '/about'
  Show an about page which displays a short biography of that person

When a user visits '/films/[name-of-film]'
  Show a description of that film and the post

Try writing the above routes using the `fs` node module to 
read in strings!
